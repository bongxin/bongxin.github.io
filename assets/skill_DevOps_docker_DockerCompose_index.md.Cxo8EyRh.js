<span class="line"><span># rest of the city of Shanghai, which have already been controlled by Japanese</span></span>

<span class="line"><span># hours.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>#</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># For example, as quoted in the article, in 1940, other than the authority</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># itself, power, tram, bus companies, cinema, department stores, and other</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># public service organizations have all decided to follow the summer time and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># spring forward the clock.  On the other hand, the custom office refused to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># spring forward the clock because of worry on mechanical wear to the physical</span></span>

<span class="line"><span># clock while those who prefer the old time standard would keep their clock</span></span>

<span class="line"><span># a. For the 1940 May 31 spring forward, the essay [says] ... &quot;Hong</span></span>

<span class="line"><span># b. For the 1940 fall back, it was said that they initially intended to do</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># so on September 30 00:59 at night, however they postponed it to October 12</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># after discussion with relevant parties. However schools restored to the</span></span>

<span class="line"><span># &quot;following the previous year&#39;s method&quot;, and in addition to that the essay</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># cited an announcement in 1941 from the Wang regime which said the Special</span></span>

<span class="line"><span># October 1, 1941, have the headlines which said &quot;French Concession would</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># rewind to the old clock this morning), but it ultimately didn&#39;t happen due</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># to disagreement between the international settlement authority and the</span></span>

<span class="line"><span># department will also change their clocks, unlike before.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>#</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># g. The essay itself didn&#39;t cover any specific changes thereafter until the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># end of the war, it quoted a November 1942 command from the government of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># Wang regime, which claim the daylight saving time applies year round during</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># the war. However, the essay ambiguously said the period is &quot;February 1 to</span></span>

<span class="line"><span># From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2013-07-12):</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># On Dec 28, 1895, the Meiji Emperor announced Ordinance No. 167 of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># Meiji Year 28 &quot;The clause about standard time&quot;, mentioned that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># Taiwan and Penghu Islands, as well as Yaeyama and Miyako Islands</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># (both in Okinawa) adopt the Western Standard Time which is based on</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># 120E. The adoption began from Jan 1, 1896. The original text can be</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># found on Wikisource:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/標準時ニ關スル件_(公布時)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># ... This could be the first adoption of time zone in Taiwan, because</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># during the Qing Dynasty, it seems that there was no time zone</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># declared officially.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>#</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># Later, in the beginning of World War II, on Sep 25, 1937, the Showa</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># Emperor announced Ordinance No. 529 of Showa Year 12 &quot;The clause of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># revision in the ordinance No. 167 of Meiji year 28 about standard</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># time&quot;, in which abolished the adoption of Western Standard Time in</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># western islands (listed above), which means the whole Japan</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># territory, including later occupations, adopt Japan Central Time</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># (UT+9). The adoption began on Oct 1, 1937. The original text can</span></span>

<span class="line"><span># That is, the time zone of Taipei switched to UT+9 on Oct 1, 1937.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span># From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-02):</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># I&#39;ve found more evidence about when the time zone was switched from UT+9</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># back to UT+8 after WW2.  I believe it was on Sep 21, 1945.  In a document</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># during Japanese era [1] in which the officer told the staff to change time</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># zone back to Western Standard Time (UT+8) on Sep 21.  And in another</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># history page of National Cheng Kung University [2], on Sep 21 there is a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># note &quot;from today, switch back to Western Standard Time&quot;.  From these two</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># materials, I believe that the time zone change happened on Sep 21.  And</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># today I have found another monthly journal called &quot;The Astronomical Herald&quot;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># from The Astronomical Society of Japan [3] in which it mentioned the fact</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># that:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>#</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># 1. Standard Time of the Country (Japan) was adopted on Jan 1, 1888, using</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># the time at 135E (GMT+9)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>#</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># 2. Standard Time of the Country was renamed to Central Standard Time, on Jan</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># 1, 1898, and on the same day, the new territories Taiwan and Penghu islands,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># as well as Yaeyama and Miyako islands, adopted a new time zone called</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># Western Standard Time, which is in GMT+8.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>#</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># 3. Western Standard Time was deprecated on Sep 30, 1937. From then all the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># territories of Japan adopted the same time zone, which is Central Standard</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># Time.</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>#</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># I coined &quot;IST/IDT&quot; circa 1988.  Until then there were three</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># different abbreviations in use:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>#</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># JST  Jerusalem Standard Time [Danny Braniss, Hebrew University]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># IZT  Israel Zonal (sic) Time [Prof. Haim Papo, Technion]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># EEST Eastern Europe Standard Time [used by almost everyone else]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>#</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># Since timezones should be called by country and not capital cities,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># I ruled out JST.  As Israel is in Asia Minor and not Eastern Europe,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># EEST was equally unacceptable.  Since &quot;zonal&quot; was not compatible with</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># any other timezone abbreviation, I felt that &#39;IST&#39; was the way to go</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># and, indeed, it has received almost universal acceptance in timezone</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># settings in Israeli computers.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>#</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># In any case, I am happy to share timezone abbreviations with India,</span></span>

<span class="line"><span># Starting in the 7th century, Japan generally followed an ancient Chinese</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># timekeeping system that divided night and day into six hours each,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># with hour length depending on season.  In 1873 the government</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># started requiring the use of a Western style 24-hour clock.  See:</span></span>

<span class="line"><span># &lt;https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1043907065&gt;.  As the tzdb code and</span></span>

<span class="line"><span># In the ordinance No. 167 (1895), &quot;standard time&quot; was renamed to &quot;central</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># standard time&quot;.  And the same ordinance also established &quot;western standard</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># time&quot;, which stands for the time on 120° E....  But &quot;western standard</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># time&quot; was abolished in the ordinance No. 529 (1937).  In the ordinance No.</span></span>

<span class="line"><span># ... what happened was that the former Kazakhstan Eastern time zone</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># was &quot;blended&quot; with the Central zone.  Therefore, Kazakhstan now has</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># two time zones, and difference between them is one hour.  The zone</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># closer to UTC is the former Western zone (probably still called the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># same), encompassing four provinces in the west: Aqtöbe, Atyraū,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># Mangghystaū, and West Kazakhstan.  The other zone encompasses</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>#</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># From 1917 until 1948-05-15, all of Palestine, including the parts now</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># known as the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, was under British rule.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># Therefore the rules given for Israel for that period, apply there too...</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>#</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># The Gaza Strip was under Egyptian rule between 1948-05-15 until 1967-06-05</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># (except a short occupation by Israel from 1956-11 till 1957-03, but no</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># time zone was affected then).  It was never formally annexed to Egypt,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># though.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>#</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># The rest of Palestine was under Jordanian rule at that time, formally</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># annexed in 1950 as the West Bank (and the word &quot;Trans&quot; was dropped from</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># the country&#39;s previous name of &quot;the Hashemite Kingdom of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># Trans-Jordan&quot;).  So the rules for Jordan for that time apply.  Major</span></span>

<span class="line"><span># East Jerusalem.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>#</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># Both areas were occupied by Israel in June 1967, but not annexed (except</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># for East Jerusalem).  They were on Israel time since then; there might</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># have been a Military Governor&#39;s order about time zones, but I&#39;m not aware</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># of any (such orders may have been issued semi-annually whenever summer</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># time was in effect, but maybe the legal aspect of time was just neglected).</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>#</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># The Palestinian Authority was established in 1993, and got hold of most</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># towns in the West Bank and Gaza by 1995.  I know that in order to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># demonstrate...independence, they have been switching to</span></span>

<span class="line"><span># if the normal spring-forward or fall-back transition occurs during</span></span>

<span class="line"><span># To implement this, I predicted Ramadan-oriented transition dates for</span></span>

<span class="line"><span># Time in Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Arabian peninsula was not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># standardized until 1968 or so; we don&#39;t know exactly when, and possibly it</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># has never been made official.  Richard P Hunt, in &quot;Islam city yielding to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># modern times&quot;, New York Times (1961-04-09), p 20, wrote that only airlines</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># observed standard time, and that people in Jeddah mostly observed quasi-solar</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># time, doing so by setting their watches at sunrise to 6 o&#39;clock (or to 12</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># o&#39;clock for &quot;Arab&quot; time).</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>#</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># Timekeeping differed depending on who you were and which part of Saudi</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># Arabia you were in.  In 1969, Elias Antar wrote that although a common</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># practice had been to set one&#39;s watch to 12:00 (i.e., midnight) at sunset -</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># which meant that the time on one side of a mountain could differ greatly from</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># the time on the other side - many foreigners set their watches to 6pm</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># instead, while airlines instead used UTC +03 (except in Dhahran, where they</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># used UTC +04), Aramco used UTC +03 with DST, and the Trans-Arabian Pipe Line</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># Company used Aramco time in eastern Saudi Arabia and airline time in western.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># (The American Military Aid Advisory Group used plain UTC.)  Antar writes,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># &quot;A man named Higgins, so the story goes, used to run a local power</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># station. One day, the whole thing became too much for Higgins and he</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># assembled his staff and laid down the law. &#39;I&#39;ve had enough of this,&#39; he</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># shrieked. &#39;It is now 12 o&#39;clock Higgins Time, and from now on this station is</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># going to run on Higgins Time.&#39; And so, until last year, it did.&quot;  See:</span></span>

<span class="line"><span># The Ho Chi Minh entry suffices for most purposes as it agrees with all of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># Vietnam since 1975-06-13.  Presumably clocks often changed in south Vietnam</span></span>

<span class="line"><span># details are unknown and would likely be too voluminous for this database.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>#</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># For timestamps in north Vietnam back to 1970 (the tzdb cutoff),</span></span>
<span class="line"><span># use Asia/Bangkok; see the VN entries in the file zone1970.tab.</span></span>
